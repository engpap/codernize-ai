# MemberController

## Overview
The `MemberController` class manages the registration process for members within the application. It is a request-scoped managed bean that interacts with the user interface and business logic layers to facilitate member registration.

## Annotations
- `@Model`: Combines `@Named` and `@RequestScoped`, making this bean accessible via EL and limited to a single HTTP request.
- `@Inject`: Injects dependencies such as `FacesContext` and `MemberRegistration`.
- `@Produces`: Indicates that `newMember` is a producer for dependency injection.
- `@Named`: Makes `newMember` accessible in EL expressions.

## Fields
- `facesContext`: Provides context for JSF (JavaServer Faces) operations.
- `memberRegistration`: Service responsible for handling member registration logic.
- `newMember`: A `Member` object representing the member being registered.

## Lifecycle Methods
- `@PostConstruct initNewMember()`: Initializes a new `Member` instance when the bean is created.

## Public Methods
- `register()`: Handles the registration process.
  - Calls `memberRegistration.register()` to persist the new member.
  - Adds a success message to the JSF context upon successful registration.
  - Reinitializes `newMember` for subsequent registrations.
  - Handles exceptions by retrieving the root error message and displaying an error message in the UI.

## Private Methods
- `getRootErrorMessage(Exception e)`: Recursively traverses the exception chain to find the root cause message for display purposes. Defaults to a generic error message if no specific cause is found.

## Usage
This controller is used in JSF pages to facilitate member registration through form submissions, providing user feedback via messages and managing the registration lifecycle.
