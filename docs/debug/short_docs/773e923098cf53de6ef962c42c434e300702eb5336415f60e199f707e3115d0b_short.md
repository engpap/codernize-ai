## MemberListProducer Class

The `MemberListProducer` class is responsible for producing and managing a list of `Member` entities within a request scope, facilitating dependency injection and event-driven updates.

### Class Overview
- **Scope:** `@RequestScoped` – the bean exists for the duration of an HTTP request.
- **Purpose:** To produce a list of members for UI rendering and update this list when member data changes.

### Dependencies
- **MemberRepository (`memberRepository`)**: Injected data repository used to retrieve member data.

### Public Methods
- **`getMembers()`**
  - **Annotations:** `@Produces`, `@Named`
  - **Description:** Provides access to the list of members via the EL variable `members` in the UI.
  - **Returns:** `List<Member>` – the current list of members.

- **`onMemberListChanged(Member member)`**
  - **Annotations:** `@Observes(notifyObserver = Reception.IF_EXISTS)`
  - **Description:** Observes member change events; when a member is added, updated, or removed, it triggers a refresh of the member list.
  - **Parameters:** `Member member` – the member entity that triggered the event.

### Lifecycle Methods
- **`retrieveAllMembersOrderedByName()`**
  - **Annotations:** `@PostConstruct`
  - **Description:** Initializes the member list after bean construction by retrieving all members ordered by name from the repository.

### Additional Information
- **Purpose of `@Named` annotation:** Allows the produced list to be accessible in UI components via Expression Language (EL).
- **Event Handling:** Listens for changes in member data to keep the UI in sync dynamically.
