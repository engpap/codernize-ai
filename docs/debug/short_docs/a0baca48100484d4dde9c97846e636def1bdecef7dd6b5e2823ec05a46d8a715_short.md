This XML file provides comprehensive documentation for the "Kitchensink" Jakarta EE quickstart application, demonstrating the integration of multiple Jakarta EE technologies such as CDI, JSF, EJB, JPA, Bean Validation, JAX-RS, and Arquillian. It serves as a detailed guide covering project structure, key classes, configuration files, REST endpoints, testing strategies, and deployment instructions.

### Overview
- **Purpose:** Showcases all features of Jakarta EE in a single project, including data validation, RESTful services, and testing.
- **Main Technologies Covered:**
  - CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)
  - JSF (JavaServer Faces)
  - EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans)
  - JPA (Java Persistence API)
  - Bean Validation
  - JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services)
  - Arquillian (Testing framework)

### Content Structure
- **Introduction:** Describes the scope and purpose of the quickstart, emphasizing new Jakarta EE features.
- **Application Components:**
  - **Web Pages:**
    - `default.xhtml`: Template with common layout elements (head, sidebar, footer).
    - `index.xhtml`: Main page with member registration form and REST endpoint links.
  - **Entities and Repositories:**
    - `Member.java`: JPA entity with validation constraints.
    - `MemberRepository.java`: Handles database interactions using JPA Criteria API.
    - `MemberListProducer.java`: Produces ordered list of members, updates on entity changes.
  - **Services and Controllers:**
    - `MemberRegistration.java`: Manages member creation, uses EJB for transactions.
    - `Resources.java`: Provides resource producers for CDI, such as EntityManager and Logger.
    - `MemberController.java`: JSF controller for user interactions.
  - **REST Endpoints:**
    - `JaxRsActivator.java`: Activates JAX-RS without XML configuration.
    - `MemberResourceRESTService.java`: Exposes member data via REST, supports JSON marshalling.
- **Testing:**
  - Arquillian-based integration tests with `MemberRegistrationTest.java`.
  - Configuration via `arquillian.xml`.
- **Deployment & Run:**
  - Instructions for deploying and running the application on a server.
- **Additional Resources:**
  - Links to Arquillian project page and configuration guides.
  - Guidance for creating custom projects from the archetype.

### Key Classes and Files
- **`Member.java`**: Defines the member entity with validation constraints and JAXB annotations.
- **`MemberRepository.java`**: Manages persistence operations for members.
- **`MemberListProducer.java`**: Produces a list of members, updates upon entity changes.
- **`MemberRegistration.java`**: Handles member registration with transaction management.
- **`Resources.java`**: CDI resource producer for EntityManager, Logger, FacesContext.
- **`MemberController.java`**: JSF backing bean for member management.
- **`JaxRsActivator.java`**: Configures JAX-RS application path.
- **`MemberResourceRESTService.java`**: Implements RESTful endpoints for member data.
- **`arquillian.xml`**: Configures deployment for Arquillian tests.
- **`pom.xml`**: Maven configuration for container selection and dependencies.

### Usage Notes
- The documentation includes commands and links to open files in an IDE for detailed code exploration.
- Emphasizes the use of CDI resource producers for consistent resource injection.
- Demonstrates validation, RESTful service exposure, and testing within a Jakarta EE environment.
- Provides deployment and testing instructions, including Arquillian configuration.
